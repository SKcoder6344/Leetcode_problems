# 🚀 My LeetCode Solutions Archive 💻

Welcome to my synchronized repository of accepted LeetCode solutions! This project documents my progress in competitive programming, providing a detailed record of solved problems and algorithms.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This repository is a personal archive containing code solutions to the challenges I have successfully completed on the LeetCode platform.

* **Primary Language:** C++
* **Goal:** To maintain a comprehensive, searchable, and up-to-date record of my data structure and algorithm implementation skills.

---

## ⚙️ How Synchronization Works (Leetsync)

This archive is automatically updated using the powerful **Leetsync** Visual Studio Code extension.

* **Automatic Commits:** Upon successfully solving and submitting a problem on LeetCode, Leetsync detects the solution and automatically commits the code to this repository.
* **Minimal Effort:** This ensures that my progress is always reflected here without manual intervention, keeping the repository current.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are systematically organized to ensure easy navigation. While the exact structure depends on the Leetsync configuration, it generally follows this pattern:
/problem-category-or-language /problem-title-or-id (e.g., /Two-Sum) SolutionFile.ext // The accepted code solution (e.g., Solution.py) README.md // Includes problem description, links, and sometimes complexity analysis.
